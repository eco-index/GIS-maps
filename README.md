# GIS-maps
Eco-index has provided publically available GIS maps on Koordinates. The three currently available maps distinguish ecosystem current status and restoration priority, a pre-human ecosystem distribution (based on work from Manaaki Whenua) with a modification to add more deliniation to wetland areas and finally the catchment areas defined by eco-index based on water draining catchments. All maps have a nation wide coverage.
